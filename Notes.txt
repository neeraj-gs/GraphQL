GraphQL TodoList Project

Problems With Rest API 
   GET /todos 
   
   1.
   Server returns an array of todos , that contains a lot of keys like userID,todoId,title,descrition etc...
   But the client renders only title on the frontend , all the other unnecessary data reduces the bandwidth and unnecessary data is sent over the internet 
      GraphQL gives only the Required fields in todo and do not need more of them
      Diffrent CLietns have diffrent requirements or fields in REST we send all the redundant data, but if we use GraphQL only necessary fields can be requested

   2.
   CLient wants the name of the userID who creted a TOdo , we need to do a seperate API Call 
   Server returns an array of users, that has all the keys such as adress, phone etc.. but required only name 
      So we can use GraphQL to use nested queries and get data in a Single Call

Solutions to REST API by GraphQL 

   1.
   Client can request only the specific data from the server
   CLient speciffies exactly the data they want. 
   todos{
      title //only title is retured by server
   }

   2.
   Client can send Nested Queries to reduve number of API requiest calling
   todos{
      title
      user{
         name 
      }
   }
   //we get the name of user who has created this todo
